Vaishavi Jayashankar 

Hi! I'm a current senior at Del Norte and a part of Mr. Mortensen's Period 2 APCSA class. 

Apart from CS, Iâ€™m a part of the Del Norte Chamber Orchestra, Jazz Band A, Jazz Combo, and Pit Orchestra where I play string/upright and electric bass. I also play tuba in Marching Band. 

I'm also the co-president and co-founder of the South Asian Student Union (SASU) San Diego and SASU Del Norte, being very passionate about sharing and celebrating South Asian culture. In my free time, you could catch me working on personal projects, watching TikTok or Netflix, traveling, or spending time with friends!
